### Periodic Trends
- Elements in the sake group (column) have similar chemical or physical properties

### Effective Nuclear Charge
- $$ Z_{eff} = Z - S$$
- the net positive charge that is attracting a particular electron in the valence shell
- Where Z is the nuclear charge
- S is the number of electrons in lower energy levels

### Measures, Trends
- measure the radius of an atom:
	- van der Waals radius: nonbonding
	- covalent radius: bonding radius
	- atomic radius: the avg radius of an atom based on measuring large numbers of elements and compounds
#### Atomic Radius 
- INCREASE DOWN GROUP
- DECREASE ACROSS GROUP (left to right)
- thus, **Fr has the greatest Atomic Radius, and He has the lowest Atomic Radius
#### Ionic Radius
- Cations (+, e.g. K+) are SMALLER than neutral atoms
- Anions (-, e.g. Cl-) are LARGER than neutral atoms
- thus, **large negative charge = large anion**
#### Ionization Energy
- the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or ion
- endothermic process (requires energy input, X spontaneously)
- $$ IE= R_H \frac {Z_{eff}^2}{n^2} $$
- Trend: **Top-right element has the greatest IE**
	- that is, He has the greatest IE, need the most energy to remove an electron from an atom or ion

#### Electron Affinity
- the energy released when an atom gains an electron in the gas state
- EA < 0: [[Chemistry Vocabs#exothermic||exothermic]]
- EA > 0: [[Chemistry Vocabs#endothermic||endothermic]]
- EA can be 0, i.e. no net change in energy
- The trends in EA similar for [[M2-Periodic Properties of the Elements#Ionization Energy|IE]]
	- Notable **EXCEPTIONS
		- low EA in
			- full s-orbital: Group 2A(2) [i.e. Be, Mg, Ca, etc.]
			- half-full shell: 5A(15) [i.e. N, P, As, Sb, etc.]
			- full shell: 8A(18) [i.e. Noble gases]
